    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"If these pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate--and 
        I didn't even separate the eggs and whip the whites. 
        Also, I used water instead of milk--and I liked them better that way. 
        I like to serve these with a pat of butter, a pinch of lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup."
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 Cup of Cold Water or Milk</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon of Baking Soda</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup of Ricotta Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Grated Lemon Zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of White Sugar</li>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1/8 Teaspoon of Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of Melted Butter</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>1 Cup of Self-rising Flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. 
                Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. 
                Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. 
                Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. 
                Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter.</li>
            <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. 
                Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). 
                When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), 
                flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate.</li>
        </ol>
